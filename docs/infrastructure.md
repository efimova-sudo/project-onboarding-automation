# Infrastructure Reference

This document describes the existing infrastructure that the onboarding
workflow reads from and writes to.

## Google Drive — Projects Folder

### Project Folder Naming Convention

```
[Client First Name + Last Name] | [Street Address, City, State ZIP] | [Project Type]
```

**Examples (synthetic):**

- `Sarah Mitchell | 3247 W Oakridge Blvd, Salt Lake City, UT 84104 | Bathroom Remodel`
- `James Porter | 6182 Maple Creek Dr, Sandy, UT 84070 | Kitchen Remodel`
- `Maria Chen | 1534 Blue Heron Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 | Full Home Remodel`

**Rules:**
- Always include full client name (first + last)
- Always include the full project address
- Always include the project type
- Use the pipe symbol ( | ) to separate sections

### Standard Subfolder Structure

Every project folder contains the following subfolders, created at onboarding:

| Subfolder | Contents |
|---|---|
| Contract & Change Orders | Signed contracts, amendments, change orders |
| Finish Material | Approved finish selections and material specifications |
| Inspirations | Client-provided references, design ideas, mood boards |
| Invoices | Client invoices, subcontractor bills, payment receipts |
| Plans & Reports | Architectural drawings, engineering reports, permits |
| Media | Photos, videos, walkthroughs, marketing assets |

### File Naming Convention

```
[Client First Name + Last Name] – [Project Type] – [Document Type]
```

**Examples (synthetic):**

- `Sarah Mitchell – Bathroom Remodel – Contract`
- `James Porter – Kitchen Remodel – Invoice #2`
- `Maria Chen – Full Home Remodel – Site Photos`

**Rules:**
- Do not add dates — Google Drive tracks created/modified dates automatically
- Always use the client's full name
- For multiple versions, append `v2`, `v3`, etc.

## PM Google Sheet — Dashboard Tab

The PM Dashboard is the central project tracking sheet. Each row is one project.
The workflow appends a new row when onboarding completes.

## QuickBooks

The workflow creates two linked objects in QuickBooks: a **Project** (with a new Customer)
and a **Project Estimate** (with line items from the contract milestones).
After the estimate is saved, a **Deposit Invoice** is sent for the first milestone.

### 1. Project + Customer

**Project naming convention:**

```
[Client Name] - [Project Type]
```

Example: `Alex Morgan - Sunroom Conversion`

**Fields written by workflow:**

| QB Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Project name | `"{client_name} - {project_type}"` | Extracted from PDF |
| Customer first name | First word of `client_name` | Extracted from PDF |
| Customer last name | Remaining words of `client_name` | Extracted from PDF |
| Customer email | `client_email` | Extracted from PDF |
| Customer phone | `client_phone` | Extracted from PDF |
| Billing address — street | Street portion of `client_address` | Extracted from PDF |
| Billing address — city | City portion of `client_address` | Extracted from PDF |

### 2. Project Estimate

Set on the estimate: `estimate_date` = contract signing date (`received_at`).

Each milestone from the PDF becomes one line item:

| QB Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Description | `milestone.name` | PDF milestones table |
| Customer rate | `milestone.amount` | PDF milestones table |
| Qty | `1` | Fixed |
| Billable | `true` | Fixed |

---

### 3. Deposit Invoice

Sent immediately after the estimate is saved.

| QB Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Product / Service | `"Deposit"` | First milestone name |
| Customer rate | Amount of the Deposit milestone | PDF milestones table |
| Qty | `1` | Fixed |
| Customer | Linked to project customer | Created in step 1 |
